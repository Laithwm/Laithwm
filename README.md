## 👋 Hey, I'm Laith

I’m a **Data Science student** at the **National College of Ireland**, focused on transforming data into stories that inform and inspire.  
My work blends **analytics, visualization, and narrative design** — because data should do more than describe; it should connect.

## 🧭 Beyond the Data

Outside of data, I’m always looking for stories and systems — whether that’s through **content creation**, **playing pool**, or **travelling**.  
Each of these keeps me curious and grounded:  

🎥 **Content Creation** – I enjoy sharing what I learn and seeing how ideas connect when expressed visually.  
🎱 **Playing Pool** – It sharpens focus, patience, and pattern recognition — skills that overlap surprisingly well with analytics.  
🌍 **Travelling** – Experiencing new places challenges perspective and teaches adaptability, both in life and in problem-solving.

> *Precision in the data. Personality in the story.*
