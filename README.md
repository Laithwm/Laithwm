## 👋 Hey, I'm Laith

I’m a **Data Science student** at the **National College of Ireland**, focused on transforming data into stories that inform and inspire.  
My work blends **analytics, visualization, and narrative design** — because data should do more than describe; it should connect.

## 📂 Featured Projects  

📊 **[Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Laithwm/Customer-Churn-Prediction)**  
Built a complete machine learning pipeline to predict telecom customer churn, including extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and model comparison (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest). Achieved **~86% accuracy** and identified key churn drivers such as contract type and payment method.

🚦 **[Dublin Traffic Volume Prediction](https://github.com/Laithwm/Dublin-Traffic-ML)**  
Applied regression models on **Smart Dublin SCATS** data (500k+ rows) to predict hourly vehicle volume. Implemented preprocessing pipelines, RFECV feature selection, and 10-fold cross-validation. **Gradient Boosting (R²=0.46)** achieved the best results, revealing strong temporal and spatial traffic patterns.

📈 **[AAPL Stock Price Forecasting](https://github.com/Laithwm/AAPL-Stock-Price-Forecasting)**  
Forecasted Apple’s closing stock prices using **ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM** models. Compared statistical vs deep learning approaches on real-world financial data, where **LSTM reduced RMSE by 2.5×** compared to ARIMA.

## 🧭 Beyond the Data

Outside of data, I’m always looking for stories and systems — whether that’s through **content creation**, **playing pool**, or **travelling**.  
Each of these keeps me curious and grounded:  

🎥 **Content Creation** – I enjoy sharing what I learn and seeing how ideas connect when expressed visually.  
🎱 **Playing Pool** – It sharpens focus, patience, and pattern recognition — skills that overlap surprisingly well with analytics.  
🌍 **Travelling** – Experiencing new places challenges perspective and teaches adaptability, both in life and in problem-solving.

> *Precision in the data. Personality in the story.*
